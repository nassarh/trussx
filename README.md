# trussx
A code for (pin-jointed) trusses where nodes are rigid bodies in 2 or 3 space dimensions.

# contents

* Includes two classes *trussx.m* and *rigidbody.m*.
* Objects of the class *trussx* are supposed to represent (pin-jointed) trusses where each node is a rigid body of finite dimensions.
* Objects of the class *rigidbody* are supposed to represent these rigid bodies.
* *testTrussX.m* includes basic examples in 2 space dimensions.
* *cloakDesignHarmonic* contains code that designs and tests an "invisibility cloak".

# notes
* The code has not been rigorously tested in 3D (not to say that it is bullet proof in 2D).
* The code uses sparse matrices.
* Initial versions of the code were written by Hussein Nassar and Phillip Brucks.
* Current version (typos and errors in particular) are due to HN.
